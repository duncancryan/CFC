To run this program locally:

- create a virtual environment with the command "python3 -m venv venv"
- to install the correct dependencies run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

(If you do not wish to use virtualenv, simply install beautifulsoup4 and requests globally using PIP)

then simply run "python3 runner.py" in the root directory. 
- This will generate two json files.
